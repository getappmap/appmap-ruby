    # Handler class for Kernel#eval.
    #
    # Second argument to eval is a Binding, which despite the name (and
    # the accessible methods) in addition to locals and receiver also
    # encapsulates the entire execution context, in particular including
    # the lexical scope. This is especially important for constant lookup
    # and definition.
    #
    # If the binding is not provided, by default eval will run in the
    # current frame. Since we call it here, this will mean the #do_call
    # frame, which would make AppMap::Handler::EvalHandler the lexical scope
    # for constant lookup and definition; as a consequence
    # eg. `eval "class Foo; end"` would define
    # AppMap::Handler::EvalHandler::Foo instead of defining it in
    # the module where the original call was made.
    #
    # To avoid this, we explicitly substitute the correct execution
    # context, up several stack frames.
    class EvalHandler < FunctionHandler
      # Kernel#eval reports the method parameters as :rest, instead of what you might expect from
      # the documented signature: eval(string [, binding [, filename [,lineno]]])
      # In the C code, it's defined as rb_f_eval(int argc, const VALUE *argv, VALUE self),
      # so maybe that's why the parameters are reported as :rest.
      #
      # In any case, reporting the parameters as :rest means that the code string, binding, etc
      # are reported in the AppMap as members of an Array, without individual object ids or types.
      #
      # To make eval easier to analyze, fake the hook_method parameters to better match
      # the documentation.

      # 4. proc generated by Hook::Method#hook_method_def

      # Note it needs to be adjusted if this call sequence changes.
